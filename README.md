UNILIB - Library management app


UniLib is an application for managing a university library written in Laravel 8. The application makes the process of checking out and returning books quite easy for the librarian by making use of QR codes. Namely, both student cards and book copies should be equipped by QR codes, which can then be scanned (using webcam) in order to complete a transaction. 

  
The application has a range of useful features, including user email notifications, deadline reminder emails, deadline extension, a basic system of fines if a book is damaged or returned late etc.
